    " 1. Mean: The mean is the average of a set of values. It's calculated by summing all values and dividing by the total number of observations. The mean provides a measure of the center of the dataset. It's sensitive to extreme values (outliers) and is widely used when data are symmetrically distributed.\n",
    " Formula: Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values).\n",
    " Example: For a set of numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, the mean is calculated as (4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2.  The median is the middle value when data are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there's an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is robust to outliers and extreme values. It's suitable for skewed distributions and provides a measure of the central value that separates the higher and lower halves of the dataset.\n",
    " Example (Odd number of observations): For a set of numbers 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9, the median is 6, as it is the middle value when arranged in ascending order.\n",

    "Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are utilized in statistics to quantify the extent of spread or variability within a dataset. They provide insights into how the data points are dispersed or scattered around the central tendency measures like mean, median, or mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:** The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",

Variance = [(2-6)^2 + (4-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (8-6)^2 + (10-6)^2] / 5 = (16 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 16) / 5 = 40 / 5 = 8. Therefore, the variance is 8.\n",

    "The right-skewed distribution, has a longer or extended tail towards the higher values(right side). This longer tail is due to a few larger values (outliers) that pull the mean in the direction of the tail. As a result of this tail extension caused by the outliers, the mean is larger than the median. This happens because the mean is influenced by extreme values (outliers) in the dataset, which can significantly affect its value and cause it to shift towards the higher end of the distribution. On the other hand, the median is less influenced by extreme values and is more robust to outliers, representing the middle value when the dataset is ordered. Hence, the median remains relatively less affected and maintains a lower position compared to the mean in a right-skewed distribution."

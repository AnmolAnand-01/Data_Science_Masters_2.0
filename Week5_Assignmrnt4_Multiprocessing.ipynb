    "Multiprocessing is a technique that allows us to take advantage of multiple CPUs or multiple CPU cores by running multiple process concurrently hence improve perforance of CPU bounded tasks. Multiprocessing creates multiple processes, each with it's own python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "Multiprocessing is useful because:-\n",
    "1. Multiprocessing allows us to achieve true parallelism. Each task has it's own interpreter and can occupy separate CPU/CPU core.\n",
    "2. Due to utilisation of different CPU cores overall performance of the application is improved.\n",
    "3. Each process has it's own memory space so the chance of data getting corrupt is significantly reduced with Multiprocessing. \n",
